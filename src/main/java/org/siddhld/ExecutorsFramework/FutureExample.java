////** Future:
//        Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. When you submit a task to an ExecutorService,
//        it immediately returns a Future<> object, which acts as a placeholder for the result of the computation that will complete in the future.

////** How does it work?
//// Task Submission:
//        When a task is submitted to an ExecutorService (e.g., a thread pool), the Future<> object is returned immediately, even though the task may not have completed yet.
//// Task Processing:
//        The task runs in a separate thread.
//// Result Retrieval:
//        You can use the Future<> object to:
//        Check if the task is complete.
//        Wait for the task to complete.
//        Retrieve the result of the task.
//        Cancel the task if needed.



//### Commonly Used Methods of `Future<>` (Simplified)

//        #### Future Methods
//
//        | Method                   | What It Does (Simplified)                                                                    |
//        |------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//        | `get()`                      | Waits for the task to finish and gives you the result when it's ready.                           |
//        | `get(timeout, TimeUnit)`     | Waits for the task to finish for a limited time. If it takes too long, it throws an error.       |
//        | `isDone()`                   | Checks if the task is finished.                                                                  |
//        | `isCancelled()`              | Checks if the task was stopped before it finished.                                               |
//        | `cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)` | Tries to stop the task. If `true`, it will interrupt the task if itâ€™s still running.      |
